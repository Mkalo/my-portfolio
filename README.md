# My Portfolio

I created this portfolio to showcase my resume and a few of my projects, as well as to practice my accessibility and internationalization skills.

## Why RedwoodJS?

I chose RedwoodJS because it is a full-stack framework that is built on React, GraphQL, and Prisma. It is also a Jamstack framework, which means that it is fast, secure, and scalable. I also chose RedwoodJS because it is a relatively new framework.

Honestly for this use case it's completely overkill, but I wanted to learn more about RedwoodJS and I wanted to be able to contribute to the community.

## What I learned

I had never used Storybook before and I really enjoyed the development experience using it. I'm also excited for the future of RedwoodJS with the release of [render modes](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/6760).

I also had the opportunity to learn more about internationalization and accessibility.

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=18.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide
>

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then change into that directory and start the development server:

```
cd my-portfolio
yarn rw dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 with the Home page of the site.
